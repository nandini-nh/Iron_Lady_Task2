# Task 2 – Internal Business Automation Solution
## Program Management Dashboard

## Overview

This project is developed as part of the AI & Technology Intern Assignment for Iron Lady.
The objective of Task 2 is to design an internal business automation solution that
supports Iron Lady’s operational workflow.

---

## Understanding Iron Lady as a Business

Before starting this task, I explored the Iron Lady website to understand how programs
are offered and managed internally.

Managing program information manually can lead to duplication, outdated data,
and inefficiencies in internal operations.

---

## Problem Statement

Program details are often tracked using spreadsheets or documents, which can result in:
- Duplicate entries
- Manual errors
- Difficulty updating program information

---

## Solution Overview

An Internal Program Management Dashboard was developed to centralize and automate
program management for Iron Lady’s internal team.

---

## Workflow

1. Admin opens the internal dashboard
2. Navigates to Program Management
3. Performs the following actions:
   - Create new programs
   - View all programs in a structured table
   - Update program details
   - Delete discontinued programs

---

## Features Implemented

- Complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Program status tracking (Active / Inactive)
- Admin-style dashboard UI
- Collapsible sidebar navigation
- Dark / Light mode toggle

---

## Business Value

- Reduces manual effort and data duplication
- Improves accuracy of program information
- Saves time for internal teams
- Improves operational efficiency

---

## Tech Stack

- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Backend: Java (Servlets)
- Architecture: MVC-style separation
- Server: Apache Tomcat

---

## Deployment Note

GitHub hosts only static files.
Backend functionality such as CRUD operations is demonstrated locally using
Apache Tomcat and is shown clearly in the demo video.

---

## Conclusion

This solution demonstrates how internal business automation can improve efficiency,
accuracy, and scalability for Iron Lady’s internal operations.
